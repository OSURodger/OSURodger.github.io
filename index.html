		<h1>CS 290 Assignment 1.</h1>
		<p>My name Corin Rodger, which is also my preferred name.</p>

		<p>My osu email adress is rodgerc@oregonstate.edu</p>

		<p>In highschool, over four years ago, I made a website showing my dogs, cat, and some basic information of something I was interested in the time: Akido. Of that, I basically don't remember anything I actually did, so I am very inexperienced in HTML.</p>

		<p>Likewise with my HTML skills, it has a been a long time since I've done any programming, so what I hope to get out of this class is a brush-up on CS in general, and experience with github.</p>

		<p>I have signed up on campus wire.</p>

		<p>I think that the most unique experience I've had is my time making robots for First Robotics competition in high school, and competing with them. Between the traveling, setting up our on-site workshop/repair shop, and sheer quantity of stuff needed to be done, every day felt new.</p>
