		<p>Apart from the initial bump with learning how to use github, the assignment itself presented little challenge. My solution for figuring out github was to</p>
		<p>re-watch the instructor's recorded lessons and search for online guides. When it came to the content of the assignment and my prior knowledge, html formatting</p>
		<p>was basically new to me. I have some light experience with code in general that made me feel somewhat familiar with it. The large portion of what I learned was</p>
		<p>git-hub itself; I learned how to pull, push, commit, and what a repository is. Of the resources I used in this assignment, I would say the lectures themselves</p>
		<p>were the most helpful, followed by web articles. Primarily, I used them to visually see examples of how to structure my work. I did not use either of the</p>
		<p>other resources.</p>
