	I was a bit better prepared for this assignment compared to the last one, but it really was a struggle. The biggest, most frustrating thing I had to learn was that global variables declared as "var" in functions would create their own private version of the variable. This made making my "copies" of the twits very frustrating until I learned to remove that. My favorite part was trying to concoct logic solutions and trying to figure out what was wrong with them (when there was an indication.) But the sneaky/hidden syntax errors were beyond aggravating. One of the sillier things I struggled with was making the twit modal appear, but it definitely braced me for all of the class declarations needed in the tweet creation feature. I do have some lingering questions though. How do you tell when to use .value or .textContent? I'm still not too sure about my ability to tell when I would be manipulating the actual elements, or just calling for some statistic about them.

		<h3><h3>Entry date 2: 4/26/2021</h3>
		<p>Going into this assignment, I was basically completely blind as to how anything worked apart from the most basic concepts of programming. That is to say, brackets, semicolons, ect. I feel like I may have been brute-forcing several elements of the CSS to make it look like the mock-up. Particularly, when making the nav-bar, and when positioning the twit icon.</p>
		<p>I couldn’t get the text in the title or in the twit content to have the correct weight as shown in the mocks. It seems that there are only three different weights for the font, and I needed one between normal and light. I didn’t find a solution to these problems really, but I think the issue with font size might actually be my screen resolution.</p>
		<p>Primarily, while doing the assignment, I used the lecture notes and w3schools to look up how to do things and what the proper formatting was.</p>
		<p>I had to google how to make the button get slightly bigger on hover. I first tried to just increase the size of the button on hover, but that didn’t work because the button would end up growing in the north-west direction. That is how I learned about the scale function. Lastly, the positioning of the search-bar itself was a lot of googling, and my solution was probably not as simple as it could have been if I had just tried to use the “position” feature.</p>

		<p>Apart from the initial bump with learning how to use github, the assignment itself presented little challenge. My solution for figuring out github was to</p>
		<p>re-watch the instructor's recorded lessons and search for online guides. When it came to the content of the assignment and my prior knowledge, html formatting</p>
		<p>was basically new to me. I have some light experience with code in general that made me feel somewhat familiar with it. The large portion of what I learned was</p>
		<p>git-hub itself; I learned how to pull, push, commit, and what a repository is. Of the resources I used in this assignment, I would say the lectures themselves</p>
		<p>were the most helpful, followed by web articles. Primarily, I used them to visually see examples of how to structure my work. I did not use either of the</p>
		<p>other resources.</p>
